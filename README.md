Sanaharava (eng. Wordsweeper) is a Finnish word-finding puzzle game inspired by [Sanalouhos of Helsingin Sanomat](https://www.hs.fi/pelit/art-2000010229611.html). In the game the player tries to form words by connecting adjacent letters in a grid. Letters can be connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is complete once all letters in the grid have been used (exactly once) to form valid words.

## Features

- **Daily Puzzles**: New AI-generated word puzzle every day
- **Real-time Highscores**: Compete with friends and see live score updates
- **Simple Registration**: Just enter your name to join the leaderboard - no email required
- **Multi-device Support**: Copy your token to continue playing on another device
- **Progress Tracking**: Completion percentage and time tracked automatically

### Highscore System

Register with a player name to track your progress on the daily leaderboard. Your score is calculated based on:

- **Percentage**: How many letters you've used (goal: 100%)
- **Completion Time**: How quickly you solved the puzzle

Once you reach 100%, your completion time is locked - you can still explore alternate solutions without affecting your score. The leaderboard shows the top players, sorted by percentage and completion time.
